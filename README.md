# 🛒 E-Commerce Website with PayPal Integration

Welcome to my **E-Commerce Website** project! This is a simple yet fully functional online store where users can browse products, add them to their cart, and complete purchases using **PayPal**. The project is built with **Django** (a Python web framework) and uses **Bootstrap** for styling.

---

## 🚀 Features

1. **Product Listing**:
   - Users can view a list of available products, including their names, descriptions, prices, and images.

2. **Add to Cart**:
   - Users can add products to their cart. The cart is stored in the browser's **local storage**, so items persist even if the page is refreshed.

3. **Cart Management**:
   - Users can view their cart, update quantities, and remove items.

4. **Checkout with PayPal**:
   - Users can proceed to checkout and pay for their items using **PayPal**. The project uses PayPal's **sandbox environment** for testing.

5. **Order Management**:
   - After a successful payment, orders are saved in the database, and the cart is cleared.

6. **Responsive Design**:
   - The website is fully responsive and works seamlessly on all devices (desktop, tablet, and mobile).

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **Backend**:
  - Django (Python web framework)
  - Django PayPal Integration (`django-paypal`)

- **Frontend**:
  - HTML, CSS, JavaScript
  - Bootstrap (for styling)
  - Font Awesome (for icons)

- **Database**:
  - SQLite (default Django database)

- **Payment Gateway**:
  - PayPal Sandbox (for testing payments)

---

## 🎥 How It Works

### 1. **Product Listing Page**
   - Users can browse all available products.
   - Each product has a **"Buy Now"** button for direct checkout and an **"Add to Cart"** button to add the product to the cart.

### 2. **Cart Page**
   - Users can view all items in their cart.
   - The cart displays the product name, price, quantity, and total price for each item.
   - Users can remove items from the cart.

### 3. **Checkout Process**
   - When users click **"Proceed to Checkout"**, they are redirected to PayPal to complete the payment.
   - After a successful payment, the order is saved in the database, and the cart is cleared.

### 4. **Order Management**
   - Admins can view all orders and transactions in the Django admin panel.
